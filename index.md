_Mathematics, cryptography  mathematics and teaching._ 

***

I am currently teaching Mathematics in CPGE (undegraduate students) since 2015.
I enjoy playing CTF, you may check my [CryptoHack profile](https://cryptohack.org/user/pierre_c/)

## Main topics of interest 

+ Elliptic Curve Cryptography
    + Pairings
    + Isogeny graphs
    + Safe curves
+ Algebraic and Algorithmic Number Theory
+ Algebraic Geometry

## Write-ups

+ _Practical Invalid Curve Attack Using Quadratic Twist_ [Available at FastInvalidCurveAttack](https://github.com/pierrechr/pierre.c/tree/main/FastInvalidCurve)

## Education 

+ _PhD._ "Jacobian Varietes and Inertia Groups" defended June 2013 at the University of Bordeaux.
+ _MSc._ Algebraic geometry, Elliptic Curves, Number Theory, Algorithmic Number Theory at the University of Bordeaux.
+ _Agrégé de Mathématiques._ French competitive high level exam to be teacher for civil service.

## Articles and Preprints

+ _Big actions with non abelian derived subgroup_ with Michel Matignon 
+ _Lifting Artin-Schreier covers with maximal wild monodromy_  in  Manuscripta Mathematica.
+ _Maximal wild monodromy in unequal characteristic_ with Michel Matignon, in Journal of Number Theory.
