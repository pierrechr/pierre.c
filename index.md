_Mathematics, cryptography  mathematics and teaching._ 

***

I teach mathematics in CPGE (undegraduate students) since 2015.

I enjoy playing CTF, you may check my [CryptoHack profile](https://cryptohack.org/user/pierre_c/)

I am [TOSA Python 3 certified](https://www.tosa.org/FR/Index?param=eW4xaE42c3c2ajhiMVZ4c29ZbEd6RXplYXBwdDB2RzBtcTN4YzFFcHc4ZHpiOEkzRDJ2M0s5cDFlMEZKM2IyWFNOYnhwV2hNWmhsbGVvVDRrTitycmc9PTo6HPD9BFdwSG_otVoECGWGKg) with score **1000/1000**.

I have also completed a consulting mission with CNES in Toulouse aimed at developing soft decoders of Reed-Solomon codes.
