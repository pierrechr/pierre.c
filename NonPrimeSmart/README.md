A comprehensive guide to the generalization of Smart's attack for anomalous curves over finite fields of non prime order.
***

## Key Takeaways

+ Smart's Attack may be used on trace one curves over non prime fields.
+ One provides a comprehensive introduction to the generalization, giving necessary background material to understand it.
+ To the best of our knowledge, one provides the first implementation of the attack for elliptic curves E/Fq with order q=p^n, n > 1.
