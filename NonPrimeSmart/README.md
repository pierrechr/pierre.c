A comprehensive guide to the generalization of Smart's attack for anomalous curves over finite fields of non prime order.
***

## Key Takeaways

+ To the best of our knowledge, one provides the first SageMath implementation of the attack for elliptic curves E/Fq with order q=p^n, n > 1.
+ One provides a comprehensive introduction, giving necessary background material to understand it.

## Materials 

+ _NonPrimeSmart.pdf_ This paper has an expository goal.
+ _Smart-Prime.py_ Implements generation of anomalous curves over a prime field and Smart's attack on these curves.
+ _Smart-Non-Prime.py_ Implements generation of anomalous curves over a non prime field and Smart's attack on these curves.
+ _search_p_D.cpp_ Naive brute force search for solutions of the norm equation.
