A Comprehensive Introduction To Invalid Curve Attack Using Twists Of Elliptic Curves.

***

## Key Takeaways

+ Invalid curve attacks are reals threats, commonly exploited. 
+ The attack boils down to solve Discrete Log Problems (DLP) on Elliptic Curves (EC)
+ By exploiting quadratic twists properly,one may solve those DLP over the base field GF(p), there is no need to extend the base field of the EC to GF(p**2).
